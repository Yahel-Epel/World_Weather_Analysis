# World_Weather_Analysis
To help the PlanMyTrip app to find the travelers travel destination with the preferred weather and create a travel map, we followed the stapes below:
    1. Retrieve Weather Data- we looked for weather for random locations worldwide and found the nearest city.
    2. Created  data frem with all the cities and that current weather
    3. We asked the traveler what max and min temperature they prefer.
    4. Summarize all the locations that answer the traveler's preferred temperature.
    5. We selected 4 cities that answered the weather request and planned a trip.
    6. Find a hotel in each location and help the travelers plan their trip.
